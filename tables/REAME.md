# Tables

This directory contains the CSV and TXT result files generated by our experiments.
They are used to produce the figures included in the IEEE Access manuscript.

## Contents

- **`mpeg7_results.csv`**  
  Raw MPEG-7 baseline results (Hu, EFD, Zernike).

- **`mpeg70_baselines_split.csv`**  
  Baseline results across multiple stratified 80/20 splits.

- **`mpeg70_bloom_results.csv`**  
  Retrieval performance with MOF–Bloom prefilter (aggregated).

- **`mpeg70_bloom_results_norm.csv`**  
  Normalized Bloom prefilter results (z-score + cosine leaf config).

- **`mpeg70_bloom_results_clean.csv`**  
  Cleaned version of Bloom prefilter results, ready for plotting.

- **`mpeg70_bloom_results_learned.csv`**  
  Bloom prefilter results using learned medoid references.

- **`mpeg70_bloom_results_learned_split.csv`**  
  Learned Bloom results on stratified train/test splits.

- **`mpeg70_bloom_routes.txt`**  
  Routing traces from Bloom prefilter (which probe fired for each query).

- **`mpeg70_bloom_routes_norm.txt`**  
  Routing traces with normalized configuration.

- **`mpeg70_bloom_routes_learned.txt`**  
  Routing traces with learned medoid dictionary.

- **`mpeg70_bloom_routes_learned_split.txt`**  
  Routing traces for learned medoids on train/test splits.

- **`mpeg7_subset_results.csv`**  
  Subset of MPEG-7 classes used for robustness checks.

- **`mpeg70_split_combined_bars.pdf`** (plotted elsewhere)  
  Uses results from the above CSVs.

- **`nd_demo.csv`**  
  Synthetic n-D demo results (Exp. 1, OP–OI scatter across dimensions).

- **`robustness.csv`**  
  Robustness experiments (jitter, smoothing, partial occlusion).

- **`retrieval.csv`**  
  Retrieval/clustering results across baselines and MOF variants.

## Notes

- All splits are stratified (80/20) and seeded for reproducibility.
- Figures in the paper are generated from these tables using scripts under `experiments/plots/`.
- See `README.md` in the repo root for usage instructions.
